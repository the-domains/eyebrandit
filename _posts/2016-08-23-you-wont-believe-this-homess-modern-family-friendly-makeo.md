  After: Living Room ELLEDECOR.com: Can you tell us a little bit about the
  house? Sean C. Juneja: Our clients came to us with a lovely New England
  colonial in a beautiful part of Greenwich, Connecticut. The community is
  charmingly rural-the clients loved the proximity to horse farms, as well as
  the easy commute to New York, where they work.
